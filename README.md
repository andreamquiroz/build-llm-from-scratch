# build-llm-from-scratch
Inspired by the book, Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch) by Sebastian Raschka

Through this textbook, I will get hands-on with the following concepts:
- Plan and code all the parts of an LLM
- Prepare a dataset suitable for LLM training
- Fine-tune LLMs for text classification and with my own data
- Use human feedback to ensure my LLM follows instructions
- Load pretrained weights into an LLM

This repo will track my journey through this textbook, from start to finish iA.
